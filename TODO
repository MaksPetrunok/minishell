+1. Clear inp_buff when Ctrl+C.
2. Manage variable $?.
+3. TAB & Spaces
4. Autocompletion for executables.
+5. Manage properly PWD, OLDPWD for "cd ." and "cd .." and for missing
	PWD, OLDPWD in environment, or for empty env.
+6. Check if env passed is empty.
7. Check TERM env.variable before launch
+8. Use fd=0 in putchar for tputs.
+9. setenv - recognize either arg1 arg2 or arg1=arg2
+10. Handle $HOME$PWD (without space separation)
+11. Track signal kill() for minishell. If catched - finish properly termcap.
12. take a look at make command within minishell
+13. add -n flag to echo
14. Track cursor motion. If cursor is at right most column of the screen -
	move it to next line after inserting a character.
15. When hit RETURN, check firs how many lines are below the cursor
	and offset cursor to not override existing output.
+16. Unset keyboard handling (terminal) when forking new process.
17. Manage terminals carefully. When env TERM is changed try to connect corresponding terminal. Show err message if cannot be found.
18. Ensure that unicode is shown properly. Multiple utf symbols cause segfault.
19. Search executables like dir/foo in PWD
	Debug it.

unset TERM
./minishell
